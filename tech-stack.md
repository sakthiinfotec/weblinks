##### Data Formats
- [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) - It's like JSON but fast and small. MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves. 

##### Microservices

##### Microservices - Communication
Typically external application clients such as web apps, mobile apps, or IoT frameworks consume RESTful API endpoints. However, modern backend developers usually don’t call microservices directly because of scaling problems and network security issues. Therefore, before exposing your microservices to the internet, developers will connect them to an API gateway or load balancer.

While inter-service communication happens via
- Synchronous - REST API, gRPC
- Asynchronous - Message-based using message brokers like RabbitMQ

**Messaging patterns:** RPC, MPI, pub/sub, CQRS
