##### Authentication & Authorization
Use case: User sign-up to a SaaS application

When we sign up a user, a few things needs to happen on the backend
  
1. Acquire the email and password user specified
2. Validate the email to see if it’s duplicated
3. Create a user account on your identity provider (most likely) such as Auth0, Clerk.com, Supabase Auth or AWS Cognito.
4. Create a record in your own database for the user you’ve just added from step 3
5. Your identity provider sends out a verification email to the user
6. The webhook of your server marks the user as verified in your own database only if it detects that the equivalent data on your identity provider tenant is marked as so.

**Mechanisms**  
- SSO tokens
- OAuth 2.0 and JWT patterns
- Auth0, Clerk.com, Supabase Auth or AWS Cognito

##### Data Formats
- [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) - It's like JSON but fast and small. MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON.

- [Envoy Mobile](https://envoymobile.io/)  
- [Istio - Simplify observability, traffic management, security, and policy with the leading service mesh](https://istio.io/latest/)  

##### Microservice - Communication
Typically external application clients such as web apps, mobile apps, or IoT frameworks consume RESTful API endpoints. However, modern backend developers usually don’t call microservices directly because of scaling problems and network security issues. Therefore, before exposing your microservices to the internet, developers will connect them to an API gateway or load balancer.

While inter-service communication happens via
- Synchronous - REST API, gRPC
- Asynchronous - Message-based using message brokers like RabbitMQ

**Messaging patterns:** RPC, MPI, pub/sub, CQRS
