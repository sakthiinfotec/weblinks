How to get better results with the help of operators?

- Exact Search
wrap it in quotes
`e.g. "cannot read property 'map' of undefined"`

- Specific Site
use site:
`e.g. site:reactjs.org Optimizing Performance`

- Exclude
add a hyphen with a term you wish to exclude
`e.g. get child element in javascript -jquery`

- Before and After
limit the time range
e.g.
`react hooks after:2020`
`angular2 before:2016`

- Wildcard
useful in combination with the others
e.g. Want to find all github sub-domains?
`site:*.github.com -www`
