#### Cloud Services
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
   * Terraform
   * AWS CloudFormation (AWS)
   * Azure Resource Manager templates (Azure)
   * Deployment Manager (GCP) 
- Manage Organizations / Projects / Groups
  * IAM Users and Roles: AWS Organizations for managing multiple accounts which can be useful if the client has multiple AWS accounts
  * Service Accounts and IAM: Use GCP's IAM to manage access. GCP Projects can also help in organizing resources where you can be granted access to individual projects instead of the whole account
  * Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Use Azure AD for identity management and RBAC for defining permissions. Azure has a concept of Management Groups and Subscriptions which can be used to delegate control.
- Cloud Shell: Each provider offers a cloud-hosted shell environment where you can run scripts and manage resources directly from the browser:
  * AWS CloudShell
  * Azure Cloud Shell
  * Google Cloud Shell
- Audit logs
   * AWS CloudTrail
   * Azure Monitor Logs
   * GCP Cloud Audit Logs
