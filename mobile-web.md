#### Web Development Skills
- Event loop
- Design patterns
- Prototypes and classes
- Regular functions vs. arrow functions
- Learn more about how web pages are rendered
- Promises and async / await
- How the internet works (generally)

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- GraphQL & Setting up GraphQL servers
- Unit testing with React Testing Library

- NextJS: it's a framework for React that is designed to work great for JAMstack projects. I'll probably be taking Wes Bos' Advanced React course when he updates it since I already purchased it.
- A headless CMS like KeystoneJS, Strapi or similar. Probably one of the cheaper ones since some are really expensive.
- AWS Lambda and other Amazon services that might come in handy.

- TailwindCSS
