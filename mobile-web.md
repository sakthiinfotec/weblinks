##### UI
- Sense of aesthetics and an eye for perfection and detail

#### Web Development Skills
- Event loop
- Design patterns
- Prototypes and classes
- Regular functions vs. arrow functions
- Learn more about how web pages are rendered
- Promises and async / await
- How the internet works (generally)
- Familiarity with implementing middleware, custom routing, and proxies
- Node.js streams, Service Workers, generators, Observables, WebSockets

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- GraphQL & Setting up GraphQL servers
- Unit testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Chrome dev tools
- TypeScript

- Authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- API Gateways
- Restful APIs (I have mostly done GraphQL at this point)
- PostgreSQL with Sequelize
- Server logging best practices beyond console.log
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Get more familiar with Postman (or Insomnia which is a free alternative)
- Authentication library like PassportJS
- Serverless and JAMstack

- NextJS: it's a framework for React that is designed to work great for JAMstack projects. I'll probably be taking Wes Bos' Advanced React course when he updates it since I already purchased it.
- A headless CMS like KeystoneJS, Strapi, or similar. Probably one of the cheaper ones since some are expensive.
- AWS Lambda and other Amazon services that might come in handy.

- TailwindCSS
- XState: a state management library
- React Hook Form
- Styled System: a helper library for Styled Components, which I already use
- Design systems

##### Concepts
**Side Effects:** Impure functions (vs pure functions) - a general concept about behaviors of functions. A function is said to have side effects if it tries to modify anything outside its body. For example, if it modifies a global variable, then it is a side effect. If it makes a network call, it is a side effect as well. In computer science, a function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state outside its scope or has an observable interaction with its calling functions or the outside world besides returning a value. For example, a particular function might modify a global variable or static variable, modify one of its arguments, raise an exception, write data to a display or file, read data, or call other side-effecting functions. In the presence of side effects, a program's behavior may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the context and its possible histories.  

**Virtual DOM:** 
* An in-memory object representation of actual HTML DOM maintained by JS libraries like React or Vue to optimize performance while manipulating it.
* When rendering/re-rendering, possibly due to state change, the previous Virtual DOM is compared with the current Virtual DOM.
* Identifies the changes and updates actual DOM. This process is called *Reconciliation*.
