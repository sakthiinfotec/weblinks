#### Authentication
Two-factor authentication (or 2FA) is the use of two separate security factors to confirm a userâ€™s claimed identity. There are three types of factors to choose from when building a solution:

1. Something the user knows like a password or PIN
2. Something the user has such as their mobile device or a code sent to you
3. Something the user is, such as a biometric

Two-factor authentication has traditionally included the use of a password as the first security factor and the second commonly includes a text with a code sent to your smartphone, or biometrics using your fingerprint, face, or retina.
