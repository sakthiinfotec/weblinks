#### Authentication
Two Factor Authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of protection used to ensure the security of online accounts beyond just a username and password. It is the use of two separate security factors to confirm a user’s claimed identity. There are three types of factors to choose from when building a solution:

1. Something the user knows like a password or PIN
2. Something the user has such as their mobile device or a code sent to you
3. Something the user is, such as a biometric

Two-factor authentication has traditionally included the use of a password as the first security factor and the second commonly includes a text with a code sent to your smartphone, or biometrics using your fingerprint, face, or retina.

There are various ways to protect accounts via two-factor authentication: biometrics, one-time passwords, phone call, email verification codes, QR codes, hardware tokens

- Fingerprints
- Retinal patterns
- Voice recognition 
- Face recognition 
- Handwritten signatures 

Options to configure 2FA are:  
**Security key:**
Use a physical security key over USB or NFC, fingerprint reader, facial recognition, or password/PIN as a security key.

**Authenticator app:**
Use an application to get two-factor authentication codes when prompted.

### [Why Microfrontends Are Taking Over (and Should You Care?)](https://itnext.io/why-microfrontends-are-taking-over-and-should-you-care-8f0fd3ff07ac)
#### Monolithic frontend
- A monolithic frontend means shared dependencies, global state management nightmares, and deployment bottlenecks.
- One small change can impact the entire application, forcing teams into long, painful release cycles.
- In monolithic frontend, you’re locked into a single tech stack — whether it’s React, Vue, Angular or something else.

#### Microfrontend
- Microfrontends aim to fix that by splitting the UI into independently deployable parts.
- One of the biggest drivers behind microfrontends is organizational scale.
- Multiple teams working on different features
- Microfrontends let each team own its piece of the UI, using its own tech stack, build pipeline and release schedule. This means a team working on the checkout flow doesn’t have to wait on the homepage team to finish their feature. Everyone moves faster because they’re decoupled from the rest of the application.
- Not every team wants to (or should) use the same stack.
- With microfrontends, one team might use React for an interactive dashboard, while another prefers Svelte for performance reasons.
- As long as they integrate seamlessly, each team gets the flexibility to choose the best tool for their job.

**They introduce their own set of challenges:**
- **Increased complexity:** Splitting a frontend means more infrastructure to manage.
- **Integration headaches:** Making sure everything plays nicely together requires a solid strategy
- **Duplication risks:** Without proper governance, teams might reinvent the wheel or ship redundant code

### [Why Island Architecture Might Be the Future of Web Performance](https://itnext.io/island-architecture-a-smarter-way-to-build-resilient-systems-0d9b36f6a067)
* You render most of the page statically, then hydrate only the interactive parts (the “islands”).
* only hydrate what needs interactivity, leave everything else as static HTML.
* Modern frameworks like [Astro](https://astro.build/press/#assets) embrace this philosophy.
* You write your page mostly as static HTML and only the parts that need interactivity hydrate when necessary.
* No unnecessary JavaScript, no wasted renders, no overcomplicated state management.
* JS frameworks (e.g. `React`) are hydrating a page. Island frameworks are hydrating components.

#### How to Get Started
Start by identifying which parts of your app actually need JavaScript:
- If a section never changes after the initial render, it doesn’t need hydration;
- If a page is mostly static content, pre-render it.
Frameworks like Astro, Qwik, and even Next.js (with partial hydration) make this process much easier.

If you’re working with React or Vue, try breaking your UI into independent components that only hydrate when necessary.

Keep global state MINIMAL.

Let the browser do what it does best : render static content quickly.


### [Hydration is Pure Overhead (Qwik's Resumability)](https://www.builder.io/blog/hydration-is-pure-overhead#resumability-a-no-overhead-alternative-to-hydration)
- [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/), a framework that is designed around resumabilty and achieves excellent startup performance.
- Hydration is a solution to add interactivity to server-rendered HTML. This is how Wikipedia defines hydration:
> In web development, hydration or rehydration is a technique in which client-side JavaScript converts a static HTML web page, delivered either through static hosting or server-side rendering, into a dynamic web page by attaching event handlers to the HTML elements.
