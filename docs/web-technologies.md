#### Authentication
Two Factor Authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of protection used to ensure the security of online accounts beyond just a username and password. It is the use of two separate security factors to confirm a userâ€™s claimed identity. There are three types of factors to choose from when building a solution:

1. Something the user knows like a password or PIN
2. Something the user has such as their mobile device or a code sent to you
3. Something the user is, such as a biometric

Two-factor authentication has traditionally included the use of a password as the first security factor and the second commonly includes a text with a code sent to your smartphone, or biometrics using your fingerprint, face, or retina.

There are various ways to protect accounts via two-factor authentication: biometrics, one-time passwords, phone call, email verification codes, QR codes, hardware tokens

- Fingerprints
- Retinal patterns
- Voice recognition 
- Face recognition 
- Handwritten signatures 

Options to configure 2FA are:  
**Security key:**
Use a physical security key over USB or NFC, fingerprint reader, facial recognition, or password/PIN as a security key.

**Authenticator app:**
Use an application to get two-factor authentication codes when prompted.
