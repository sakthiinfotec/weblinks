### BOM explosion
In supply chain management, a BOM explosion refers to the process of breaking down a product's bill of materials (BOM) to reveal all its constituent parts, materials, and specifications required for production. This process helps in understanding the complete product structure and planning material requirements. [1, 2, 3]  
Elaboration: 

• Purpose: BOM explosion is crucial for: 
	• Identifying all components needed for a product.
	• Understanding the product's structure.
	• Planning and forecasting material requirements.
	• Analyzing costs at different levels of the product structure.

• Process: The process typically involves: 
	• Starting with a top-level BOM for a product.
	• Breaking down each component into its own BOM, revealing subassemblies and raw materials.
	• Repeating this process until all levels of the product structure are fully detailed.

• Benefits: 
	• Improved inventory management.
	• Reduced material costs.
	• Enhanced production planning.
	• Better understanding of product complexity.

• Examples: 
	• A laptop's BOM can be exploded to show the individual parts of the screen, keyboard, motherboard, etc., and then further explode each of these into their respective components.  
	• A car's BOM can be exploded to show the engine, chassis, wheels, and then each of these can be further exploded to show the components they are made of.

• Tools: Various software systems like SAP and Microsoft Dynamics 365, Interlake Mecalux, and Mecalux International offer features for performing BOM explosion.
• Considerations: The way a BOM is exploded can be customized based on the specific needs of a business, including whether to include all levels or just specific parts, Interlake Mecalux, and the complexity of the product.
