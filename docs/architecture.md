In **Dependency Injection (DI)**, services are registered with different lifetimes that determine how and when instances are created and reused. Two common lifetimes are **Singleton** and **Transient**. Here's a breakdown:

---

### üîÅ Singleton Services

- **Definition**: A singleton service is created **only once** during the application's lifetime.
- **Behavior**: The same instance is reused **every time** it is requested.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for **shared resources** like logging, configuration, or caching services.

**Example**:
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
```
Every time `IMyService` is injected, the **same instance** of `MyService` is used.

---

### üîÑ Transient Services

- **Definition**: A transient service is created **every time** it is requested.
- **Behavior**: A **new instance** is provided each time it is injected or requested.
- **Use Case**: Best for **lightweight, stateless** services.

**Example**:
```csharp
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
```
Each injection of `IMyService` results in a **new instance** of `MyService`.

### üîç Comparison Table

| Feature         | Singleton                     | Transient                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Instance Count | One per application            | One per request               |
| Lifetime        | Application-wide              | Short-lived                   |
| Memory Usage    | Lower (if reused effectively) | Higher (if overused)          |
| Thread Safety   | Must be thread-safe           | Less concern (short-lived)    |

#### [SOLID principles](https://x.com/NikkiSiapno/status/1890986211633959413)
- S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle
- O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle
- L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle
- I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle
- D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle

Let‚Äôs break down each principle

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each unit of code should only have one job or responsibility. A unit can be a class, module, function, or component. This keeps code modular and removes the risk of tight coupling.
2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Units of code should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to extend functionality with additional code rather than modifying existing ones. This principle can be applied to component-based systems such as a React frontend.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** You should be able to substitute objects of a base class with objects of its subclass without altering the ‚Äòcorrectness‚Äô of the program. An example of this is with a Bird base class. You might assume that it should have a ‚Äòfly‚Äô method. But what about the birds that can‚Äôt fly? Like a Penguin. In this example, having a ‚Äòfly‚Äô method in the Bird class would violate LSP.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Provide multiple interfaces with specific responsibilities rather than a small set of general-purpose interfaces. Clients shouldn‚Äôt need to know about the methods & properties that don't relate to their use case.
    - Complexity ‚Üì
    - Code flexibility ‚Üë
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** You should depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes. Use abstractions to decouple dependencies between different parts of the systems. Direct calls between units of code shouldn‚Äôt be done, instead interfaces or abstractions should be used.

These principles gives a lens into the foundations of clean code which can be applied to many areas of programming.
