#### E2E App Design and Developement using AI
- Database design (this workflow that saves time AND delivers scalable results)
  - Input the PRD into ChatGPT (I use GPT-o1, but GPT-4o works just as well)
  - Ask it to create a detailed, scalable database design:
    - Define tables
    - Outline their purposes
    - Specify relationships
  - Once weâ€™re satisfied, save the output to db-design markdown file and store it in Cursor for easy reference throughout development
- Try gemini- Use it to ideate and ask it to create PRD in markdown. Let it build schema, api contracts, user docs etc.
