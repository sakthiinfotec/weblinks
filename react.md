##### [Advanced Data Fetching Technique in React](https://asimzaidi.medium.com/advanced-data-fetching-technique-in-react-for-senior-engineers-9d9b6f95d50b)

There are several popular techniques for fetching and managing data in React, including the built-in `fetch()` function, using a library like `axios`, and the latest and powerful library [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/).

###### Build-in fetch() function
The built-in fetch function is the simplest approach to fetch data. It is a web standard for making network requests and is supported by most modern browsers. The fetch function returns a promise that resolves with a Response object, which can be used to access the response data. However, it doesn't provide an elegant way to handle errors or cancel requests. Additionally, it doesn't have built-in support for caching, which can be a crucial feature for many applications.

```javascript
fetch('https://example.com/data')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

###### axios
Using a library like axios provides more control over network requests. It provides a more powerful and flexible way to handle errors, timeouts, and other network-related issues. Additionally, axios has built-in support for interceptors, which allows you to easily add cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, or error handling to your requests.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

axios.get('https://example.com/data')
  .then(res => console.log(res.data))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

While these approaches are solid solutions, they still have some limitations. For example, caching and pagination are not handled by default, and you have to implement them yourself which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where React Query comes in.

###### [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/)
React Query is a powerful and modern library that provides a more optimized way of fetching and managing data in React. It provides a way to handle caching, pagination, and real-time updates out of the box. React Query also provides a way to handle errors and loading states in a consistent way. It also allows you to easily share and reuse data across your application, which can greatly simplify your codebase.

```javascript
import { useQuery } from 'react-query'

const fetchData = async () => {
  const {data} = await axios.get('https://example.com/data')
  return data
}
function MyComponent() {
  const { status, data, error } = useQuery('data', fetchData)
  
  if (status === 'loading') {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  if (status === 'error') {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }
  return <div>{data.name}</div>;
}
```

Caching is one of the most powerful features of React Query, it allows you to store the results of a query so that it can be reused on subsequent requests. This can greatly improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of network requests needed. React Query also allows you to configure the cache expiration and eviction policy.

Pagination is another powerful feature of React Query, it allows you to easily handle pagination in a consistent and efficient way. With React Query, you can easily implement both client-side and server-side pagination with minimal setup. React Query also allows you to easily track the loading state, error state, and data state of your paginated queries.

```javascript
const fetchPage = async (key, page) => {
  const {data} = await axios.get(`https://example.com/data?page=${page}`)
  return data
}

function MyComponent() {
  const { status, data, error, isFetching } = usePaginatedQuery(['data', page], fetchPage)
  
  if (status === 'loading') {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  if (status === 'error') {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
      <button onClick={() => refetch()} disabled={isFetching}>
        {isFetching ? 'Loading...' : 'Next Page'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

React Query is a powerful and modern library that provides a more optimized way of fetching and managing data in React. It provides a way to handle caching, pagination, and real-time updates out of the box. React Query also provides a way to handle errors and loading states in a consistent way. It also allows you to easily share and reuse data across your application, which can greatly simplify your codebase. When working with React, it’s essential to have a solid understanding of the various ways to fetch and manage data. By utilizing a library like React Query, senior engineers can ensure that their applications are performant, scalable, and provide a great user experience.

##### [Advanced React Optimization Techniques](https://asimzaidi.medium.com/advanced-react-optimization-techniques-for-senior-engineers-dafd2cac7883)

###### Event Emitters
One effective way to improve the performance of your React app is to use event emitters. Event emitters allow you to send data from one component to another without having to pass the data through the component hierarchy. This can be especially useful if you have a deep component hierarchy and you want to avoid having to pass data through multiple levels.

###### Memoization
Memoization is a technique that allows you to cache the results of a function so that you don’t have to recalculate them every time the function is called. This can be particularly useful for optimizing expensive calculations that don’t change very often, such as rendering heavy UI graphs.

###### Virtualization
Virtualization is a technique that allows you to only render the components that are visible on the screen, rather than rendering the entire component hierarchy. This can be especially useful for optimizing the performance of large lists or grids, as it reduces the number of components that need to be rendered and allows the app to respond more quickly to user interactions.

###### IndexedDB
IndexedDB is a browser-based database that allows you to store large amounts of data locally in the user’s browser. By using IndexedDB, you can store data locally and retrieve it quickly, rather than having to make a roundtrip to the server every time you need to access it. This can be especially useful for optimizing the performance of apps that deal with a lot of data, such as trading apps.

###### Stream data
Another way to optimize the performance of your React app is to stream data rather than loading it all at once. By streaming data, you can reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded at once and allow the app to respond more quickly to user interactions.

###### Lazy loading
Lazy loading is a technique that allows you to only load the components that are needed at a given time, rather than loading the entire component hierarchy upfront. This can be especially useful for optimizing the performance of large apps with many components, as it reduces the amount of data that needs to be loaded at once and allows the app to respond more quickly to user interactions.

###### React Suspense
React Suspense is a new feature in React that allows you to declaratively specify how your app should behave while data is being loaded. This can be especially useful for optimizing the performance of apps that deal with a lot of data, as it allows you to specify how the app should behave while data is being loaded, rather than having to manage this manually.

###### Concurrent rendering
Concurrent rendering is a technique that allows your React app to perform multiple rendering tasks at the same time, rather than waiting for one task to complete before starting another. This can be especially useful for optimizing the performance of apps that deal with a lot of data, as it allows the app to respond more quickly to user interactions and deliver a smooth, seamless experience.

##### [Event Emitters in React: A Deep Dive](https://asimzaidi.medium.com/event-emitters-in-react-a-deep-dive-c3558d7a94dc)
Event emitters are a powerful tool for improving the performance of your React app. They allow you to send data between components without passing it through the component hierarchy. This can be especially useful if you have a deep component hierarchy and want to avoid passing data through multiple levels. In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into how event emitters work in React and how you can use them to improve the performance of your app.

As you may know, React is a powerful library for building user interfaces, but it can be challenging to optimize the performance of complex apps. Event emitters provide an alternative approach to pass data between components without having to pass it through the component hierarchy. Instead, components can register to receive data from an event emitter, and when the event emitter sends data, it will be received by all registered components. This allows you to decouple your components and makes it easier to manage complex data flows.

Imagine we have a shopping basket component as a Parent component and a “Buy” button as a Child component. We want the “Buy” button (child) to execute some code in the Parent when it is pressed.

```javascript
export const Basket = () => {
  const [total, setTotal] = useState('');
  ... More component logic here ...  
  const onBuyClick = () => {
    showTotal(total);
  };

  return <BuyButton onClick={onBuyClick}/>;
}
```

This is a perfectly valid React callback implementation but with Event Emitter, it can be improved.

```javascript
export const Basket = () => {
  const [total, setTotal] = useState('');
  const eventEmitter = useEventEmitter()
  ... More component logic here ...  
  const onBuyClick = () => {
    eventEmitter.emit('eventName', {total})
  };

  return <BuyButton onClick={onBuyClick}/>;
}
```

Now the BuyButton component can emit an event that is handled by the parent.

```javascript
const Basket = () => {
  const eventEmitter = useEventEmitter()
  useEvent('eventName', (data) => {
    showTotal(data.total)
  })
  ... More component logic here ...  
  
  return <BuyButton/>;
}
```
Event emitters provide a flexible and powerful way to pass data between components in React. By decoupling your components and allowing them to communicate through events, you can make your app more responsive and easier to understand.

Event emitters aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution, it is important to use them appropriately. As your application grows, it can be challenging to keep track of all the events and listeners that are used. This is where good documentation, testing, and proper planning
