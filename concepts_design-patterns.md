###### gRPC
```
* A High performance protocol built on top of HTTP/2
* Ideal for the communication between Microservices
* It's a modern, fast and efficient, built on top of HTTP/2, low latency, supports bi-directional Streaming, language independent, 
* Makes it super easy to plug in authentication, load balancing, logging and monitoring
* Clients open long lived connection to a gRPC server
* At the core, define messages and services using Protocol Buffers i.e Machine readable contracts
* Supports timeout at client side, eventually cancels the request at server side
* Supports interceptor for Logging + Metrics in production environment
* It efficiently connects services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health-checking, and authentication.

#### Node.js
* Events
* Streams
* Express.js
* JavaScript testing frameworks (Jest, Enzyme, Mocha, etc.)

#### CSS
* SASS
* Media Queries
* Flexbox
* Grid Layout

#### JavaScript
* Method Binding
* Module (Default export & Named export)
* Iterator (Symbol Iterator)
* List iteration
* Generators
* Promise
* Automated Tests

#### React
* Components (Class & Functional)
* Pure Component
* Component Lifecycle phases (Initialization/Constructor, Mount, Update & Unmount) & methods
* HoC - Component transforms props into UI, But HoC transforms a component into another component
* Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, useLayout, useReducer, useRef) & 
* Custom Hooks - Reuse stateful logics between components / Alternative to HoC to some extent
* useEffect() - With / without deps
* useRef - Child nodes to trigger animations, select text, or manage the focus
* Rules for React Hooks
* Actions & Reducers
* JSX => Babel => React.createElement(name, props, value)
* Conditional Rendering
* Fragment
* Key in List Iteration
* Suspense & Eror Boundary
* State vs Props (Immutable, Passed from Parent to Child)
* Data passes Downwards + Event bubbles Upwards
* Lifting State up
* Context, Context Provider, Context Consumer, useContext() - For pass Props through nested components i.e props drilling
* Global State, Context, Redux Store
* Redux - Configure and use store
* Virtual DOM
* State Reconciliation (Diffing with DOM snapshot) using Fiber Engine
* SSR vs Server Side Component - Next.js
* Async operations using Saga vs Thunk
* RTK Query (Query, Mutation, transform, tags)
* React Router
* Lazy Loading Components
* Code Splitting - With code-splitting, React allows us to split a large bundle file into multiple chunks using dynamic import() followed by lazy loading these chucks when we need them with React.lazy
* React Testing Library and Cypress
