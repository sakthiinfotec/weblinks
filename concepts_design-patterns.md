#### JavaScript
* Method Binding
* Module (Default export & Named export)
* Iterator (Symbol Iterator)
* List iteration
* 

#### React
* Components (Class & Functional)
* Pure Component
* Component Lifecycle phases (Initialization/Constructor, Mount, Update & Unmount) & methods
* HoC
* Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, useLayout, useReducer, useRef) & 
* Custom Hooks - Reuse stateful logics between components / Alternative to HoC to some extent
* useEffect() - With / without deps
* useRef - Child nodes to trigger animations, select text, or manage the focus
* Rules for React Hooks
* Actions & Reducers
* JSX => Babel => React.createElement(name, props, value)
* Conditional Rendering
* Fragment
* Key in List Iteration
* Suspense & Eror Boundary
* State vs Props (Immutable, Passed from Parent to Child)
* * Data passes Downwards + Event bubbles Upwards
* Lifting State up
* Context, Context Provider, Context Consumer, useContext() - For pass Props through nested components i.e props drilling
* Global State, Context, Redux Store
* Redux - Configure and use store
* Virtual DOM
* State Reconciliation (Diffing with DOM snapshot) using Fiber Engine
* SSR vs Server Side Component - Next.js
* Async operations using Saga vs Thunk
* RTK Query (Query, Mutation, transform, tags)
* React Router
* Lazy Loading Components
